# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for debugging and categorizing bugs found in the My Toolbox Python application. The toolbox is a comprehensive desktop utility framework built with Tkinter that bundles multiple independent tools into one modern graphical interface.

## Glossary

- **Toolbox_Application**: The main Python desktop application that provides a unified interface for multiple utility tools
- **Tool_Module**: Individual Python modules in the tools/ directory that implement specific functionality
- **Bug_Category**: Classification system for organizing identified issues by type and severity
- **Dependency_Issue**: Problems related to missing or incorrectly imported external libraries
- **UI_Inconsistency**: Visual or behavioral differences between tools that should follow the same patterns
- **Error_Handling**: Code sections that manage exceptions and provide user feedback
- **Code_Quality**: Issues related to maintainability, readability, and best practices

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the toolbox, I want all bugs to be systematically identified and categorized, so that I can prioritize fixes effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Toolbox_Application SHALL be analyzed for all types of bugs and issues
2. WHEN bugs are identified, THE Bug_Category SHALL classify each issue by type and severity
3. THE analysis SHALL cover all Tool_Module files in the tools directory
4. THE analysis SHALL identify Dependency_Issue problems across all modules
5. THE analysis SHALL document UI_Inconsistency problems between tools

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dependency and import issues to be clearly identified, so that I can ensure all required libraries are properly installed and imported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE analysis SHALL identify all missing import statements
2. THE analysis SHALL detect incorrect or inconsistent import patterns
3. WHEN Dependency_Issue problems are found, THE system SHALL list the affected modules
4. THE analysis SHALL verify that all dependencies in requirements.txt are actually used
5. THE analysis SHALL identify duplicate dependencies in requirements.txt

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI consistency issues to be identified, so that all tools provide a uniform user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE analysis SHALL identify tools that don't use the base_tool.py framework
2. THE analysis SHALL detect inconsistent theming and styling approaches
3. WHEN UI_Inconsistency is found, THE system SHALL specify which tools deviate from standards
4. THE analysis SHALL identify tools with hardcoded colors instead of theme variables
5. THE analysis SHALL detect missing or inconsistent button styling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling and code quality issues to be identified, so that the application is robust and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE analysis SHALL identify missing Error_Handling in critical operations
2. THE analysis SHALL detect potential runtime errors and exceptions
3. THE analysis SHALL identify Code_Quality issues like unused imports or variables
4. WHEN error handling is missing, THE system SHALL specify the affected code sections
5. THE analysis SHALL identify potential security vulnerabilities in file operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want functional bugs and logic errors to be identified, so that all tools work as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE analysis SHALL identify logical errors in tool implementations
2. THE analysis SHALL detect potential runtime failures in core functionality
3. THE analysis SHALL identify incorrect file path handling
4. WHEN functional bugs are found, THE system SHALL describe the expected vs actual behavior
5. THE analysis SHALL identify tools with incomplete or broken features
